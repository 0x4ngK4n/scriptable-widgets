### My various attempts to automate data processing on iOS using scriptable.

> So what is Scriptable?

As per **Scriptable**'s description of themselves: _Scriptabled is an automation tool that enables you to write scripts that integrates with native features of iOS such as files, calendars, reminders, documents and much more._

> But why Scriptable?

So, basically with Scriptable, you can write JavaScript code using Scriptable's API and that code interacts with various native iOS features. 
The possibilities of this are endless as you can integrate Scriptable with iOS Shortcuts and/or automation to create awesome workflows!

> And what did I explore in it?

During my time of experimentations with Scriptable, I wanted to focus on and explore the possibilities of Scriptable with Widgets.
Basically, my aim was to display certain tid-bits of data which I can obsessively glance over the iOS Widgets so as to feed my hunger of data :rofl:
