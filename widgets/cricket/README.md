# Cricket score tracker widget for iOS (Powered by Scriptable)

### As an Indian I am indeed a cricket fan. I'd love to keep tabs at the ongoing matches and their statuses.
It just struck me that I could use Scriptable to pull data from a source and parse to display the adequate data on Widget.

Currently the Scriptable script only tracks the International matches played by the top-10 ranking teams across various cricket formats.
Anyone can modify the script to extract more data and display according to their requirements.
